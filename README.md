# The Pyro programming language

This repo contains a compiler for the Pyro programming language.
It is probably best described as a C-like language, but that may change as I am designing the language on the fly while writing it.

At the present moment, the compiler is neither mature nor well documented.

# Why a new programming language?
I am writing this compiler mainly to get better at writing Rust and as an effort to learn LLVM as an IR.
